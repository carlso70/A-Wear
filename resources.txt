Stackoverflow: iOS Background audio recording
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42020124/ios-background-audio-recording

	See the first paragraph for background audio recording.
	Should work for us as you begin the recording in the
	foreground.

Slider iOS Tutorial:
https://www.ioscreator.com/tutorials/slider-ios-tutorial-ios11

	Super rudimentary slider for creating a 0-100 value. Can be
	used for deciding max volume level.

Stackoverflow: How to make iPhone vibrate using Swift?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26455880/how-to-make-iphone-vibrate-using-swift

	really quick easy fix for creating a vibration. Has multiple
	implementations.

Tutorial: Detecting When A User Blows Into The Mic
https://web.archive.org/web/20090823020843/http://mobileorchard.com/tutorial-detecting-when-a-user-blows-into-the-mic/

	GREAT short tutorial to realtime check audio levels to detect
	when the user goes past a certain volume level.


Stackoverflow: how to monitor audio input on ios using swift - example?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35929989/how-to-monitor-audio-input-on-ios-using-swift-example

	Good example code on using AVFoundation classes. Similar
	application allows for good translation to our use. The only
	problem is that it's for iOS. Also includes references to
	'metering' audio which is what we will most likely be doing.


Stackoverflow: Is it possible to record audio using Apple Watch in background (screen off)?
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46794542/is-it-possible-to-record-audio-using-apple-watch-in-background-screen-off

	Has a simple solution for receiving the right permissions.


Stackoverflow: I want to call 20 times per second the installTapOnbus:bufferSize:format:block:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26115626/i-want-to-call-20-times-per-second-the-installtaponbusbuffersizeformatblock/26600077#26600077

	Someone implementing a realtime waveform display, which is
	very close to what were doing. We are essentially creating
	a system that will vibrate when the waveform becomes too
	large. This post is about a limit on AVAudioEngine having
	buffers that are too large to be able to truly be
	realtime, but contains various possible fixes.


Tutorial: Audio Recording in watchOS Tutorial
https://www.raywenderlich.com/345-audio-recording-in-watchos-tutorial

	Isn't realtime audio processing, but is a really good start
	for learning the various necessary utilities to look through
	to be able to play around with receiving audio on the watch.
	We could possible look into recreating the tutorial, but
	switch to automatically record many small recordings, which
	would then be used to process and analyze sound level.
	(We would do various recordings per second, essentially
	realtime)


Github: SwiftyAudio
https://github.com/arielelkin/SwiftyAudio/blob/master/SwiftyAudio/ViewController.swift

	Made for working with AVAudioEngine, has real example of
	using realtime audio processing. May not be exactly what
	we need, but we could derive from it.


Vimeo: Ariel Elkin: Real-Time Audio using Swift
https://vimeo.com/125703971

	From the creator of the SwiftyAudio github, a 37 minute
	presentation on the basics of audio processing using
	AVAudioEngine. IF we are able to use AVAudioEngine,
	this would be incredibly valuable explanation.
